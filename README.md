# ml-exploration
A hands-on repository for implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch and experimenting with PyTorch. This project is structured to encourage both theoretical understanding and practical experimentation.

## What's Inside?
- **Classical Machine Learning**: Core ML algorithms (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes) implemented in structured Python classes.
- **Neural Networks from Scratch**: Custom-built deep learning models without relying on external frameworks.
- **PyTorch Experiments**: Deep learning projects, including computer vision experiments.
- **Jupyter Notebooks for Visualization**: While implementations are structured in Python files, results are visualized and analyzed using Jupyter notebooks.
